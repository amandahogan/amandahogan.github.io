    <strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong>
    <p>I noticed when programming through phase 0, that some of my triggers are, I don't know enough or I don't understand the instructions or I don't know where to start and usually this leads to a disproportionate emotional response. Another trigger is, how did I let myself get this far behind and how do I catch up, what level of work do I need to produce. Am I learning the right things, am I wasting my time on getting stuck, is my time well spent on the tasks required.</p>
    <strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong>
    <p>I found going through the excersice useful. I can see how doing it retroactively can help with reflecting on the situation and help you deal with future triggers better as you will be better trained. I don't think I would be able to imitate a successful Siberian North Railroad excercise in the moment right now, but it will be something I will try to work towards, now that I understand the framework at least I can stop and breath before reacting and then hopefully take notice of the trigger to then be able to reflect and respond appropiately.</p>
