  <h5>Let me tell you about a time ...</h5>

  <strong>I was blocked on a simple problem</strong>
    <p> I was blocked on simple javascript excercise on codecademy, seems like I've been blocked on a few of those excercises. I tried reading the error message and trying to print different things onto the console. When that wasn't working I tried googling the error message and see what google will yield or if was something about the concept I didn't understand. I'd move on to something else if I was still blocked and try to come back to it, taking time on other tasks sometimes helps you clear your mind and look at previous code in a different light, or just time away from the screen will help you look at code in a different light. If I still couldn't work through the problem I would ask for help from peers/ coaches although I think it would be nice to be able to have solved the problem on my own. I felt frustrated at times as what I was trying wasn't able to help me get unblocked from the issue. Most of my problems on codecademy was due to syntax and typos. I learnt to write cleaner code.

  <strong>I solved a problem in an elegant way</strong>
    <p> I don't know if I have solved a problem through coding in an elegant way as of yet. Can I come back to this one?
    </p>

  <h5>Reflect on these problem solving techniques</h5>

  <p>I haven't done too much pseudocoding so far, as I usually tend to work through problems in my head. I can see the benefit of pseudocoding though as sometimes ideas in my head doesn't translate well on paper.</p>

  <p>Trying something is how I learn best, I think most of my code so far has been trial and error, seeing what the console prints out and what error message I receive might be the method that gets me through most of my problems, it also means that sometimes I get stuck on what I'm trying if I don't know what to try next to make it work.</p>

  <p>The Rubby ducky method, hasn't been one that I use a lot but I think explaining a problem aloud to yourself can really help you get to the bottom of it, especially when it sounds different to what you have in your head.</p>

  <p>Reading error messages! Need a lot of practice so that my brain understands what the computer is telling me!</p>

  <p>I enjoy this method, as when the message is clear I know what to do to fix it or what to google. However this is something I struggled with immensely when using codeacademy, I just didn't understand some of the error messages especially if it was about syntax or a typo.</p>

  <p>I love google! remember a time google didn't exist...</p>

  <p>When I've been starring at the computer screen for too long I'll ask my peers or coaches, I think I leave it a little bit late to ask for help from them, but when I do their immediacy in answers always gets me back on track</p>

  <p>reflection helps with process as you are able to identify what you did well and what you can improve on next time so that little steps make your learning process more efficient in the long run</p>

  <h5>Terminology: "Learning the Lingo"</h5>

      <strong>.map()</strong>
      <p>.map() calls each element in an array and then constructs a new array from the matching results.</p>

      <strong>.filter()</strong>
      <p>.filter() allows you to call each element in an array and then construct a new array if the statement equals true.</p>

      <strong>.reduce()</strong>
      <p>.reduce() let's you remove an element from an array.</p>
