    <h1>MEDITATION</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
      <p>
        I tackled it by going through the task and ticking things off as I went through, it gave me a lot more time focusing on research and playing with features instead of just producing a perfect final product, which I'm still trying to achieve.
      </p>

      <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>

      <p>
        I thought of meditation as a way to relax and reflect and be present in the world at a moment in time, a way to create mindfulness by connecting back to your innerself and giving yourself the attention it needs. personally though I've never committed to any form of meditation, let's be honest most of us don't have the time to do it and are just attracted to the idea of it. Only thing close I can think of is I gave yoga a go about 2 years ago and haven't revisited since, I probably should.

      <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>

      <p>
        <em>“It’s really just mental training”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding mindful meditation is “Breathing as if your life depends on it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Three levels of meditation includes: Attention, Meta-attention and Concentration
      </p>

      <p>
        Reducing stress levels through minful meditation. Also meditation can help cure tangible things as well (who knew)
      </p>

      <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>

      <p>
        Sitting down like a majestic mountain and focusing on being present and if I'm up to it my breathing for 10 mins each day.
      </p>

      <h5>Any other musings?</h5>

      <p>
        I enjoyed the scientific research behind it that is explained in the chapter, I really do think this will help justify spending time on practicing mindful meditation and eliminating preconceived notions on the benefits of meditation. From the book this excerpt sums it up really well: “It is remarkable that mindfulness helps improve everything from attention and brain function to immunity and skin disease”
