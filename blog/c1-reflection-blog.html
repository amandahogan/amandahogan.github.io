      Restaurant vs. Kitchen Mindset
      My take on the EDA experience is that it will be a completely new learning style to my previous education experiences.
      In the video Shereef explains the culture with a metaphor on two different mindsets.
      In the restaurant mindset you walk into the bootcamp and you see what's on the menu, whats the price tag? Ok, I'll have that and it gives you an entitled mindset because you paid for a service, so you expect a certain kind of experience.
      In a kitchen mindset, you are not in consumer mode, you are in a creative mindset, you are all working in the kitchen with different levels of experiences but you're all there to create and help each other create amazing new things.
      I think that this is a great way for everyone to empower their own learning experience and education.
      I'm really excited in getting involved with this type of culture. I probably will struggle at the beginning as I am so use to the consumer mindset that I procrastinate quite a bit when it comes to doing tasks and assignments.
      My expectations of EDA have remained the same as when I signed up for the course.
      Hopefully it will allow me to be more proactive in my learning.
