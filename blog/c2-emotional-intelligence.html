    <h1>What learnings di you take from the chapter?</h1>

    <p>
    From the chapter I took that emotional intelligence can help me with  stellar work performance, outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness from the context of a work environment

    What I found interesting was that the best leaders in any environment is basically the nice people as per excerpt from the book.
        “When I think of military leadership, I think of tough-as-nails people barking orders and expecting to be obeyed, so it is fascinating to me that even in a military environment, what distinguishes the best leaders from the merely average ones is emotional intelligence. The best military commanders are basically nice people who are fun to be with. Funny enough, the title of the Bachman study was “Nice Guys Finish First.”

    The aim of developing emotional intelligence is to help you optimize yourself and function at an even higher level than what you are already capable of”

    “We feel that if we develop skills, behavioral issues automatically go away. ”

    “Emotional intelligence is trainable, even in adults. ”

    “We begin by training attention. This may seem a little counterintuitive at first. I mean, what does attention have to do with emotional skills?
    The answer is that a strong, stable, and perceptive attention that affords you calmness and clarity is the foundation upon which emotional intelligence is built.”

    <h1>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h1>
    <p>
      It's an interesting concept. definitely short enough that it is achievable and as it mentions in the book great for introducing myself to mindfulness as I have a short attention span. It was suprisingly easy to do as it's the weekend and I'm doing study now but I think it would be harder to do when I have to make the consious decision to do it on a daily basis. only time will tell.
