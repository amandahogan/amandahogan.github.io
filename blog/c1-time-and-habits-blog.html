    <h1>Time Management</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a little bit of a misfit when it comes to time management and life in general. Two habits I'm personally aware of that affects my productivity levels are

      1. My Optimistic nature
      2. Being a Perfectionist

      These are both my greatest assets and biggest downfalls.

      For Example, as an optimist I'm always happy to help and jump in where I can which is a great attitude to have for work. However this can lead to taking too much on, and most of the time more then I can handle. An article I read, explains simply the positive and negative aspects of this personality trait by relating it to how optimists are usually late. This is because they believe they can get more done in the timeframe they have. i.e. I have an hour before my meeting, the drive takes 20 minutes, I need 10 minutes for parking, and 10 minutes to prepare, I still have 20 minutes to stop at the post office and mail this letter before the drive.

      Being a perfectionist I also don't want to hand in half hearted work, I want to complete things to the best of my ability, but when you have less time then you think you have you tend to produce work not to the standards you expect, therefore I end up procrastinating to the point where I know I have a substantional amount of time to commit to these tasks. This is where I found the article on timeboxing and the pomodoro technique useful. I will start Toggl in 25 minutes intervals to see how that affects my productivity and attention span. (sometimes I feel like I have and attention span of a 5 year old.)

      Lastly is when I'm overwhelmed I seem to think today is the day I get everything done and it leads to nothing getting done! Instead I'm going to try this great tip:

      COUNTERINTUITIVE TIP #3: TRY TO GET ALMOST NOTHING DONE

      Do not start your day thinking, I need to accomplish everything! Do not start a project thinking, I need to finish this today. This leads to paralysis and indecision.

      Instead, get insanely micro.

      Focus on doing two minutes of important work on whatever it is you want to do. Set a timer and just do two minutes. Anyone can do two freaking minutes.

      Starting and getting momentum is the hardest part. Getting insanely micro is the cure.

      Misfits are plagued by procrastination because we have no tolerance for doing things we don’t want to do.

      The whole point of being productive should be to do things that are interesting and meaningful to you so that you feel good.

      If you don’t feel good at the end of the day, then what’s the point?
