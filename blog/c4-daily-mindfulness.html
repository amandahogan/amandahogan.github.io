    <h1>DAILY MINDFULNESS</h1>

      <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
      <p>
      Full disclaimer I did my first mindfulness converstaion with my 15 year old brother. I found that I noticed his mannerisms more when he was talking. His body language portrayed that he was eager to complete this excercise with me as soon as possible as I had interupted his afternoon gaming session with his friend in Canada. I learned that I didn't find it hard to do mindful listening for 3 minutes when it was an excersice to complete, including looping and dipping and that I actually paid attention to what he was saying (he's generally the talker so I can ignore him from time to time). He found the mindfulness conversation weird, like going to an AA meeting and explaining your day he chimed in while I was the speaker, he also managed to laugh and ask questions.

      <h3> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>

      <p>
       Take one breath a day, this seems to be achievable! and I'll try finding a mindfulness buddy as well. I'll post it up in my accountability this week on slack and see if I can cohort someone to be my mindfulness buddy.

      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>

      <p>
      I found it interesting that a Tibetan meditation master thought the same thing as I did when he was a beginner that people are attracted to the idea of meditating but don't enjoy the practice as much.
