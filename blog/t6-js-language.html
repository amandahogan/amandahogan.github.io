  <strong>Parentheses ():</strong><p> execute a function/loop/if else statements. They encase the parameters or conditions.</p>

  <strong>Brackets []:</strong><p> are used to encase Arrays. A list of information. You will also see brackets used when you are accessing a value in an array. i.e. [0] will access the first element within an array.</p>

  <strong>Braces {}:</strong><p> help define the start and end of a function, they encase blocks of code.  They also identify an Object, whether the object is empty or has keys and properties.</p>

  <strong>Single quotes '':</strong><p> can be used in event handlers, when the event references an element in the DOM. It can be used to denote ID and CLASS (although double quotes will do the same. The important thing to remember is consistency between the two.)</p>

  <strong>Double quotes "":</strong><p> are used to denote strings, strings are pieces of information that is plain text and not code.</p>
