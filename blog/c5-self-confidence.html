  <h1>SELF CONFIDENCE</h1>


<strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong>
<p>They are essentially the same thing!</p>
<strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong>
<p>I tried the body scan exercise for two reasons, I have a hard time writing things on paper although the studies behind journaling is mind blowing and I have trouble shutting my brain off when going to bed and the idea that body scanning was able to rest the body and mind intrigued me. So I tried it before going to bed one evening and I found it useful to draw attention to different parts of the body. Especially the my back because as it mentioned in SIY it carries a lot of tension and I felt there was a lot of tension there. I also found different emotions arising while I was doing the body scanning excersice most of them negative and that's not a great way to feel before going to bed, maybe that's why I have trouble sleeping.</p>
<strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>
<p>That if you can distinguish that your emotions are not who you are you can take action on them and take control of your emotions and not let it affect you.</p>
