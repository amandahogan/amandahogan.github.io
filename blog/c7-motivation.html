  <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
<div class="container">
  <strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong>
  <p>Life looks pretty good from this lens, it defines happiness as an underlying state, and even though we feel the seas are rough and choppy on the surface it is stable and calm below. It kinds of somes up the book quite nicely where mindfulness teaches us to move from an existensial phenomenon to a physiological phenomenon. If we were to look at life through this lens it would show us the bigger picture and we can see that any storm will pass.</p>
  <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>What are your core values?</li>
  <p>I struggled with this exercise. I wrote down a lot but I think I'm having an identity crisis... or have always had an identity crisis! After a lot of writing and reading and re-reading. I narrowed down my core values to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Being Inspired - Think this is my biggest core value. I think keeping yourself inspired helps a lot with dealing with life, finding new experiences and things to look forward to. This includes travel, for sights and cultural immersion and to constantly learn and reflect on how big and small the world is. </li>
    <li>Adventure - Constantly challenging yourself and exploring new adventures both local and global</li>
    <li>Respect - for the environment, for other people, for strangers and friends a like, for my work and work of others.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>What do you stand for?</li>
  <ol>
    <li>An individual who can only try their best and respect others for trying their best as well.</li>
  </ol>
  </ul>

  <strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong>
  <p>I found it useful, I noticed my negative and positive responses during this excercise. I noticed that my responses in regards to an event where I have failed had very negative emotions and physical reactions. I completely understood the pessism viewpoint SIY was explaining, where you believe its your inadequacy and that there is nothing you can do to overcome that failure. On the other hand the feelings and reactions you get when thinking back to a success was great, It gave you the pleasure high of achieving something. This is definitely an aspect I need to work on, where I address failures as actionable setbacks to success.</p>
