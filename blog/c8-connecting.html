    <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
    <p>I didn't get a chance to try the insights and techniques this week, but will definitely try the SIY version of the Metta Bhavana practice in stealth mode next time I have a conflict with someone. I've recently moved in with my parents again after living independently for 7 years plus. I have a feeling this will come in very handy with the current situation. I also like the idea of asking people who I've just met or currently know how they want to save the world, so that I can create a positive association for that person everytime I see them. </p>
    <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
    <p>have scheduled a time slot to complete this with a friend this evening. <em>watch this space!</em></p>
    <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
    <p>I found that after the excercise during my 1 minute of resting the mind I was a lot calmer, and i was a lot easier to rest the mind and hold attention then when I did my 2 minute resting the mind before the exercise. I like the traditional practice structure too. I think I will try a few minutes of this practice in the morning, this week.</p>
    <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>
    <p>A Scenario of a conflict... and accounts on each person's point of view where they are both 100% correct and 100% reasonable.</p>
