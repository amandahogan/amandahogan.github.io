      <strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is content. When building a house HTML is the type of walls (brick, cedar, plaster), floors (tile, wood) and ceiling.
      DOM is the structure created from the HTML tags. In the analogy of building a house it would be the floor and the ceiling and the walls combined together to create the infrastructure of the house.
      CSS is the style. CSS adds colour and tones and texture to the walls, tiles and windows.

      <strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Boxifying design is when you think of all elements on a webpage as box. From the header to the images to the text. You can have big boxes and sub boxes within the bis boxes. By thinking of everything on the web in terms of boxes, boxes for miles! you can easily rearrange content to give users a different experience.

      <strong>What is the box model?</strong>
    </p>
      <a href="http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/box-model.html">The Box Model:</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Margin: Space between boxes. Completely transparent.</li>
        <li>Border: Boxes the padding and content.</li>
        <li>Padding: Space inside the box that protects the content.</li>
        <li>Content: The subject either text or image.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
        The size of your elements in a boxifying design is the combination of all these elements in a box model.
