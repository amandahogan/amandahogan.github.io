                        A good way to look at what HTML CSS and the DOM is to use the house analogy. HTML can be seen as the structure of the website and is like the different parts of a house. For example a webpage in HTML is split up into different sections, just as a house
                        is split into different rooms, HTML organises these sections.

                        <em>Grid based design</em> is breaking the layout of the page into different boxes. By doing this it is really easy to layout the page and work out what is going to go where and how to do it. A page might not always look like it
                        is sitting on a grid, but if you break it down and draw boxes round the sections, you'll soon see that it is.

                        A responsive website is an approach to web design that allows the site to be viewed from all different devices no matter the size. This is particularly important as we live in an age where people want and can get information on the go, and designing a user-friendly responsive site can make the difference on how your information is relayed to customers.

                        <strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong> compares differently to HTML and CSS as it is used for website functionality, this means it is able to process data and tells a page how to behave, where as HTML dictates structure, i.e. how the contents is divided, and CSS dictates style, i.e. how the page looks.

                        <strong><em>Problem Solving</em></strong> is an important skill to have when coding. This weeks technical blog reflects on the problem solving techniques that have been introduced to me and how well I utilise them as well as the method my brain follows when I'm blocked on a simple problem. There's more array lingo thrown in there too.
